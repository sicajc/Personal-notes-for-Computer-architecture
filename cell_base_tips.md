# Vivado Debug tips
1. Run simlulation on VIVADO
2. Check eleborate xvlog and clear every warning before going into dc
3. Fatal simulation error might come from coding style and you can check more using RTL elboration and Synthesis.
4. The variable declaration must be all put to the highest position of the module.


## WaveForm viewer
1. You can group and add Divider to clearly seperate signals for better visualization.

## Debug breakpoints
1. Debug breakpoints would halt the waveform everytime a certain signal changes value.
2. At the same time add monitoring to display value of the related signal for better debugging experience.
